<h1 id="what-is-bns3">What is BNS3?</h1>
<p>The Basic Needs Student Success Survey (BNS3) is a survey focused on assessing food insecurity, health, and assistance program effectiveness for undergraduate students who are currently enrolled in the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP). This specific pilot that I worked on is the second study conducted by the Center for Healthy Communities at Chico State, and was administered to students at three CSU campuses: Chico, Fresno, and Northridge. The main purpose for this second cross-sectional study was to revise the BNS3 tool and validate student perception on impact of assistance programs before the statewide dissemination (which we are currently working on now).</p>
<p>The homepage of the website does a much better job at explaining the background, run time, and purpose of the survey than I do, so please feel free to <a href="https://chicocalfresh.github.io/bns-pilot2-website/index.html">click here</a> to view the page.</p>
<h1 id="data-processing">Data Processing</h1>
<p>I never really understood how much data processing you truly do with real world data until I began working on this project. If you&rsquo;ve done any kind of data science or machine learning project than you&rsquo;ve mostly likely had experience working with data from Kaggle or similar websites, and there is some data processing involved in order to get it into a usable format. Fill missing values with the column mean, change some data types around, a little feature engineering magic here and there. But nothing too serious right? We&rsquo;re talking maybe a couple hours and 100 lines of code before you&rsquo;re ready to go. And that&rsquo;s what I figured when I heard that I&rsquo;d be processing the survey data for BNS3 (spoiler: it wasn&rsquo;t that easy).</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I was expecting, maybe like a short questionnaire of Yes/No and numerical responses that I could clean up in a couple hours? But then I opened the data file&hellip; And cried a little bit inside. Hundreds of questions (all of which needed to be reformatted) and what would turn out to be my biggest enemy, free response questions. I still have nightmares about trying to parse them into usable answers, but it&rsquo;s okay now&hellip; I think.</p>
<p>So I started cleaning, and 30 hours later, I thought I had finally finished. But then I met with my supervisor, found more things to reformat, and another 30 hours of cleaning began. Repeat this processes over the first month of my research program and I finally finished the cleaning script (kind of at least). An entire month just for cleaning data&hellip; And it wasn&rsquo;t even finished. 6 months later I still go back and add updates here and there when I find an error or we change our minds on a previous decision. But it was a learning experience like no other, real world data isn&rsquo;t as pretty as &ldquo;machine learning ready&rdquo; data sets you find online, and spending weeks figuring out how to process data was one of the main learning experiences from my research program. But also I&rsquo;d be happy if I don&rsquo;t see any uncleaned data for a while.</p>
