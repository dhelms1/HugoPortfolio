 So Close&amp;hellip; Yet So Far If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, then most likely you too have some type of interest in machine learning or data science. And you know that GPUs are amazing for speeding up the processes you do in this fields, especially for Deep Learning. However if you&amp;rsquo;re currently in the market for one of these GPUs, especially the new NVIDIA RTX Series which would be PERFECT for Deep Learning projects, you know how impossible it is to find one of them (special thanks to all the crypto miners and resellers out there).</description>

 Introduction Welcome! This is the first of many posts for the #tidytuesday data exploration project in which I explore a smaller data set with no goal of creating a model but strictly to become more familiar with R and packages such as dplyr, tidyverse, &amp;amp; ggplot. In this week, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the IMDb data set that recorded information such as seasons, date, average rating, and shares for TV dramas from 1990 to 2018.</description>
