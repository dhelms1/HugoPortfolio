 Introduction MRI scans are one of the main tools used for analyzing tumors in the human brain. Huge amounts of image data are generated through these scans, which need to be examined by a radiologist, and can be susceptible to diagnosis error due to complex MRI scans. This is where the application of neural networks come in. Through Convolutional Neural Networks, we are able to process these scans in order to extract low level features that can help us correctly classifying and diagnose brain tumors.</description>

 Alright, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it&amp;hellip; It sounded a lot cooler in my head. &amp;ldquo;Battle of the Learning Methods: Statistical vs Machine Learning&amp;rdquo;. Man vs. Machine (well not really, but you get the point). A test of speed, strength, learning, and maybe a little bit of overfitting. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me that&amp;rsquo;s excited about the project, but I finally get to implement what I learn in school against what I do in my free time.</description>

Note: An in-depth data exploration section was also created, but will not be explored in this post. I will mainly focus on the modeling section, please refer to the GitHub link above for the DataExploration.ipynb notebook.
 The More The Merrier&amp;hellip; Right? The current world population is nearly 7.8 billion people, and this number is estimated to rise to around 9.7 billion (or higher) in the year 2050.</description>
