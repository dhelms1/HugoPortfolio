 Alright, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it&amp;hellip; It sounded a lot cooler in my head. &amp;ldquo;Battle of the Learning Methods: Statistical vs Machine Learning&amp;rdquo;. Man vs. Machine (well not really, but you get the point). A test of speed, strength, learning, and maybe a little bit of overfitting. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me that&amp;rsquo;s excited about the project, but I finally get to implement what I learn in school against what I do in my free time.</description>

Note: An in-depth data exploration section was also created, but will not be explored in this post. I will mainly focus on the modeling section, please refer to the GitHub link above for the DataExploration.ipynb notebook.
