Hello! I am currently a grad student at Oregon State University pursuing my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence. I had started my journey at Sierra Community College in 2015 as a Business major, eventually switching to Accounting, and then Computer Science, and finally transferring to Chico State in the Fall of 2019. While at Chico I completed my B.S. in Mathematics (Statistics focused) and a minor in Computer Science, graduating in May 2022. Following this, I continued my education into grad school where I am currently studying in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and will graduate in June 2024.

Outside of my education I mainly focus on developing skills in machine learning, applying both what I learn in class and on my own. I've worked on projects including image classification of brain tumors, stroke prediction using statistical modeling, and regression modeling for predicting food production needs.

During my time at Chico State, I worked at the Center for Healthy Communities as an Undergrad Research Assistant and Community Health Assistant. The main focus of my work had been being the lead programmer on a series of integrated scripts to manage administration and compensation for a multi-site health survey. I have also worked on revising the BNS3 website I built during my research program (see [blog post](/p/bns3website/) for more information) in order to prepare it for publication.

Currently, I am working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the Engineering department. Specifically, in the ENGR+ courses that focus on developing skills for first year engineering majors in the areas of criticial and algorithmic thinking. 

Thank you for taking a look at my website and I hope you find something you enjoy!
