Hello! I'm currently a student at Chico State pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with an option in Statistics and a minor in Computer Science. I had started out at Sierra Community College in 2015 as a Business major, eventually switching to Accounting and then Computer Science, and finally transferring to Chico State in the Fall of 2019 as a Mathematics major. 

Outside of my education I mainly focus on developing skills in machine learning, applying both what I learn in class and on my own. I've worked on projects including image classification of brain tumors, stroke prediction using statistical modeling, and regression modeling for predicting food production needs.

I currently work at the Center for Healthy Communities as a Community Health Assistant, continuing the work that I started during my summer Undergraduate Research Assistant program. The main focus of my work has been being the lead programmer on a series of integrated scripts to manage administration and compensation for a multi-site health survey. I have also worked on revising the BNS3 website I built during my research program (see [blog post](/p/bns3website/) for more information) in order to prepare it for publication.

Thank you for taking a look at my website and I hope you find something you enjoy!
