I'm currently a student at Cal State University, Chico pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a focus on statistics. My main area of concentration is in machine learning, working on projects including image classification and statistical modeling. This website will be a place for me to share my work publicly with more in depth explanation and exploration.
