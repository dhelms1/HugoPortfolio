Hello! I'm currently a student at Cal State University, Chico pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a focus in Statistics. I had started out at Sierra Community College in 2015 as a Business major, eventually switching to Accounting and then Computer Science, and finally transferring to Chico State in the Fall of 2019 where I once again changed my major (fourth times the charm) from CS to Mathematics and I've loved it ever since. 

Outside of my education I'm mainly focus on developing skills in machine learning, applying both what I learn in class and on my own. I've worked on projects including image classification of brain tumors, stroke prediction using statistical modeling, and regression modeling for predicting food production needs. I am currently focused on developing my skills in R, taking what I have learned about machine learning in Python and transferring it over to a new programming language.

This website will be a place for me to share my work publicly with more in depth explanation and exploration compared to my GitHub. I'll also be posting about my journey throughout my Summer Undergraduate Research Internship with CSU Chico. Thank you for taking the time to look at my website and I hope you find something that interests you!
