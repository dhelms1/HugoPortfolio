Hello! I'm currently a student at Cal State University, Chico pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and a minor in Computer Science. I had started out at Sierra Community College in 2015 as a Business major, eventually switching to Accounting and then Computer Science, and finally transferring to Chico State in the Fall of 2019 as a Mathematics major. 

Outside of my education I'm mainly focus on developing skills in machine learning, applying both what I learn in class and on my own. I've worked on projects including image classification of brain tumors, stroke prediction using statistical modeling, and regression modeling for predicting food production needs.

I currently work at the Center for Healthy Communities as a Data Science Intern, continuing the work that I started during my Undergraduate Research Assistant program. This mainly focuses on writing code scripts that automate survey processes from the previous pilot from the upcoming statewide pilot, revising the website built during the research program, and assisting in expanding the survey for the upcoming pilot.
