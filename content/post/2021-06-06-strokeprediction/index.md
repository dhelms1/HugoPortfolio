description: In this project I compare the performance of Statistical and Machine Learning models for predicting whether or not a patient will have a stroke. The data set has a large class imbalance, so comparing the performance of sampling methods with a Generalized Linear Model vs. an Ensemble Model that performs sampling while training is the focus of this project.

# Alright, I'll admit it...
It sounded a lot cooler in my head. "Battle of the Learning Methods: Statistical vs Machine Learning". Man vs. Machine (well not really, but you get the point). A test of speed, strength, learning, and maybe a little bit of overfitting. Maybe it's just me that's excited about the project, but I finally get to implement what I learn in school against what I do in my free time. This term I took both Sampling Methods and Applied Statistics II, and this brought me to think if I could create a project that implemented the material from those classes and my knowledge of Machine Learning? This project was the answer. 

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, with over 140,000 people dying annually. Each year approximately 795,000 people suffer from a stroke with nearly 75% of these occurring in people over the age of 65. Using medical record information (age, gender, BMI, smoking, diseases, etc.) we will create models that can accurately predict whether or not a patient has had a stroke. The main goal for this project will be to reformat the data to handle the large class imbalance (respective to the given model), engineer any new features we may find during our exploration, and finally compare the performance of multiple models on the data in order to determine the winner of this battle.
