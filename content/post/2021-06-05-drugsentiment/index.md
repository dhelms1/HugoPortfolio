description: In this project I use TensorFlow and Amazon SageMaker to analyze the sentiment of Prescription Drug Reviews in order to classify them into 3 categories - negative, neutral, and positive. The main focus of this project is to learn the workings behind Natural Language Processing, Recurrent Neural Networks, and formatting the model/data to be used in SageMaker.

# Introduction
*This project is currently in progress and will be completed throughout the summer in my free time from work. EDA has been completed but data preprocessing and modeling have not, see GitHub repo* **drug_data_analysis** *for what has been done so far. Currently storing this file at the bottom of my website for future use (can't hide as draft for some reason and I'm too lazy to rewrite the 50 words I have so far...)*
