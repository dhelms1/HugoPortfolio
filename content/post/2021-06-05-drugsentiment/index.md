description: In this project I use TensorFlow and Amazon SageMaker to analyze the sentiment of Prescription Drug Reviews in order to classify them into 3 categories - negative, neutral, and positive. The main focus of this project is to learn the workings behind Natural Language Processing, Recurrent Neural Networks, and formatting the model/data to be used in SageMaker.
