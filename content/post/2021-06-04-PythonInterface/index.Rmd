# Python Interface with R

This is a test for interfacing Python with RMarkdown using the [**Reticulate**](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package.

```{python, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
import tensorflow as tf
```

- *NOTE*: The above code chunk is displayed but not executed, which is what we want in order to avoid rerunning previously executed code (images will be inputted for graphs and results).
