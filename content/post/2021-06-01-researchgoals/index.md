description: A brief overview of what I hope to accomplish during my 2 month research internship with the CHC (Center for Healthy Communities). This includes Personal, Academic, and Research Development skills that I aim to learn throughout this experience and how to carry them forward into higher education.

# Introduction
6/1/2021 marks the first day of my Research Intership with the CHC (even though I'm writing this almost 2 weeks later) and I have some mixed emotions about how I feel about it. I'm not saying I don't like the program (it's quite the opposite), I'm beyond grateful for the opportunity. But I am nervous. Will I be able to keep up with everyone whose already been working on the project? What if I don't deliver everything I need to at the end of the program? Am I going to be able to learn everything or will I fall behind? There's a lot of questions I keep asking myself, the programs use of R and Data Analysis are new to me. I work on Deep Learning projects using Python (*quick shameless plug: go check out some other posts on my website about these projects*), and there isn't much analysis for images or text data (some, but not to the extent of a survey with over 250 features). All these new methodologies have me feeling a little overwhelmed, but I'm also excited. 

I love learning (I've been in college for almost 6 years so I guess I better love it) and this is a summer of learning, but without the stress of grades. No midterms, no finals, no suprise quizzes on the one topic you decided to skip reading. I'm excited to see where the program takes me and how I will develop both as a person and a researcher.

## What exactly is the Internship?
For the summer, I'll be working on the second version of the Basic Needs Student Success Survey (BNS3) and helping to prepare the third. The first version was aimed towards Chico State students, the second was 3 CSU schools, and the third will be aimed towards getting it distributed across California. Pulled from the [BNS Website](https://chicocalfresh.github.io/bns-website/index.html): 

> The purpose of this cross-sectional pilot study was to create a tool that identifies student perception of the impact of receiving CalFresh assistance on their health, nutrition, cooking confidence, time management and academic performance.

My main purpose will be analyzing the findings from the second version of the survey and creating a website to present these findings (similar to the above current BNS Website). In no particular order I have three main personal goals for this program: master R and Data Analysis techniques, become familiar with research environments/procedures that I can take with me to Grad School, and finally use the tools learned during the program by applying them to mini projects.
